# WebDev — Lecture Examples

A small static front-end project containing example pages for three lectures. Each lecture has its own HTML file and the shared stylesheet.

## Structure

- [lecture1/index.html](lecture1/index.html) — Lecture 1 example
- [lecture2/index2.html](lecture2/index2.html) — Lecture 2 example
- [lecture3/index3.html](lecture3/index.html) — Lecture 3 example
- [style.css](style.css) — Shared stylesheet

## Description

This repository contains simple static pages used for learning and demonstrating basic web development concepts (HTML and CSS). It's intended for local viewing and quick experimentation.

## Run / Preview

Open any of the lecture HTML files directly in your browser (double-click), or run a simple local HTTP server from the project root:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

## Usage

- Edit the HTML files under each `lecture` folder to update content.
- Modify `style.css` to change site styling across all lectures.
